This is a very simple Reddit Bot for my subreddit r/politicsindia

This bot scrapes the current vote counts for each candidate from Election Commission of India's website and updates a post in the subreddit with the latest vote counts for each candidate every 1 hour.


This project is for the 2024 General Elections. Vote counting stars from the 4th of June, 2024.
